    <h1>Thank you for your participation!</h1>

    <p>We're reaching out to inform you that you've recently been part of a carefully designed phishing exercise on our website. This exercise was intentionally challenging to identify, and your involvement has provided valuable insights.</p>

    <p>If you revisit the initial email, you may notice a subtle but crucial clue - a misspelling in our organization's name, as well as a discrepancy in the hyperlink you clicked on. These details, though seemingly minor, are common markers of phishing attempts.</p>

    <p>Unfortunately, we must clarify that the offer of movie tickets was a part of this exercise. We understand the disappointment, but this was a deliberate strategy to encourage quick action without thorough scrutiny - a common tactic used in actual phishing attacks.</p>

    <p>The purpose of this exercise was to enhance awareness and understanding of the sophisticated methods used in phishing scams. We appreciate your involvement in this learning experience and hope it has been enlightening.</p>

    <p>As we approach the holiday season, it's crucial to remain vigilant. Phishing attempts, often appearing legitimate and from well-known sources like Optus, Microsoft, DocuSign, and Australia Post, become more prevalent and challenging to identify.</p>

    <p>We encourage you to participate in additional training and resources we offer to help you better identify potential phishing emails in the future. Remember, your cybersecurity is a priority for us, and we're here to support you.</p>

    <p>If you have any concerns or need assistance in identifying such threats, please don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:peter.ornsby@insigniafinancial.com.au">reach out</a>. Let's work together to stay safe online.</p>

    <p>Best regards,<br>Peter Ornsby</p>
